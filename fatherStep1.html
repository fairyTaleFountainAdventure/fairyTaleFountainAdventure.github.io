                have more mature interests.” He stumbles upon the skate park and thinks that maybe the children have grown
                to like these things. As soon as he enters the park, he is met with uncertainty. There are people sharing a
                backwood off to the side, young ones bumping some of the latest techno that he recognizes from the clubs,
                and adults skating and playing ball. The father persists though. He plays ping-pong to a game of 5 with some
                of the people, asking for the whereabouts of his children. He then goes to the basketball court, asking if
                anyone has seen the children. No one knows about them. Disappointed, he thinks that they must be still too
                young for these interests.
