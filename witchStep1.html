                The witch has the means to fatten up the children, but the quality of the meat can only do so much. The
                witch thinks, “no stew is good without proper seasoning.” There it is, right by the restaurants they spot a
                garden filled with herbs. The witch picks a clove of lavender to put in their stew later.
