            <p>Thank you for playing.  
                If you have beaten the witch to their lair, you have won the game and saved the children.  
                If you did not beat the witch, ensure that they have a clove of lavender and a bottle cap to ensure they completed their task.  
                You can never trust a witch to play fair
