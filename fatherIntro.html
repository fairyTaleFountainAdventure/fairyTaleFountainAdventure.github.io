                but another more subtle feeling lingers in his mind – he doesn’t really know his children at all. 
                He doesn’t know where to start looking for them because he is not aware of their interests. 
                Then a distant memory comes into his mind – he remembers taking Hansel and Gretel to the playground when they were toddlers. 
                He thinks to himself, “surely they still love the playground.” 
                The father travels to a park, he finds a playground with a lone cottage styled building but the children are nowhere to be found. 
                Disappointed, he thinks that they must have outgrown the playground.</p>
