                The witch has everything they need to cook the children. As they picked up the ice cream and gathered herbs,
                the witch felt how ingrained and methodical the whole process felt. The witch knows that they have done this
                before – and a lot. They feel a calling to the bell across the lake. Once at the bell, the witch recites an
                ancient spell and summons jewels. “Great,” they think, “now I have more jewels to lure children to the trap.
                They continue on towards their trap.
