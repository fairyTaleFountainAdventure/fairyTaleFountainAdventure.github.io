                There exists an “other-world” – a world that runs parallel to ours but is not visible. But what if we can
                exist in both worlds? Two consciences, one brain.
                A long long time ago lived a family of four nestled away in the other-world. Both the children loved their
                father very much but the father’s love for them was strained. The father loved his kids but couldn’t afford
                to feed them. One day he had enough. “Away with you both!,” he shouts. His children are shocked by the
                conviction in his voice and flee without being told twice. Unknowing to the father, the children become
                trapped in the grasps of an evil witch. The father regrets shooing away his children. His cries for the
                children pierce the sky and open a portal from our world to the other-world - creating two statues of his
                children forever frozen in time.
                On a glorious day in 1988, two people with long bushy hair and dressed in that rebellious Berliner black
                from our world walk in front of these statues. With a characteristic suave, they each flip a coin - one gets
                heads and the other gets tails. They are immediately whisked into the “other world” – the first person
                becomes the father and the second becomes the evil witch.
